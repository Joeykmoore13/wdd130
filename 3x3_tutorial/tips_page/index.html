    <h2 class="title">Extra tips and tricks</h2>
    <hr class="line first_line">
    <p>This page is for once you have completed the main tutorial. It includes some tips on memorising algorithms, some faster ways to do some of the steps, and some more advanced methods if you would like to start getting faster. </p>
    <p class="note">This page is a work in progress. More will be added as time goes on</p>

    <!-- possibly add more efficent white cross tips -->
    <h2>White Corners</h2>
    <hr class="line">
    
    <p>There is another more efficent way to insert some corners. It looks like the case below.</p>
    
    <img src="../images/alt_white_corner_setup.png" alt="white corner setup image">
    
    <p>The other way of inserting the corner moved it out of the way first and then lifted the cross piece up. This one lifts the corner with the cross piece. The moves look like this</p>
    <img src="../images/alt_corner_move_1.png" alt="alternate corner insert move 1 image">
    <img src="../images/alt_corner_move_2.png" alt="alternate corner insert move 2 image">
    <img src="../images/R_U'_R_solved.png" alt="corner solved image">
    <p>As you can see it is a little harder to undestand what is going on but it uses less moves and doesn't reqire any cube rotations or extra setup.</p>
    
    <h2>Second layer</h2>
    <p>This section will cover some trick on memorizing the algorithms for the second layer.</p>
    <p>First we need to figure out which way the edge needs to go. For this example we need it to go into the slot on the right.</p> 
    <img src="../images/F2L_right.png" alt="F2L right case image">    
    <p>To start we are going to move the piece the opposite direction we need it to go. So for this example the edge will be solved when it goes to the right so we are going to start by moving it to the left like this:</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_one.png" alt="F2l right case move one image">
    <p>Then we are going to lift the corner up to the top layer like this</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_two.png" alt="F2l right case move two image">
    <p>Then we are going to bring our edge back to where it started like this</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_three.png" alt="F2l right case move three image">
    <p>Then we are going to fix our cross edge while 'sticking' the corner to the edge like this</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_four.png" alt="F2l right case move four image">
    <p>Now we are going to move our paired pieces out of the way like this</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_five.png" alt="F2l right case move five image">
    <p>Then we'll lift our other cross edge, put the edge in, and then fix our cross edge like this</p>
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_six.png"  alt="F2l right case move six image">
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_seven.png" alt="F2l right case move seven image">
    <img src="../images/F2L_tricks_eight.png" alt="F2l right case move eight image">

    <h2>Cross edges</h2>
    <p>This section will cover tips on how to memorize the algorithm to solve the cross edges</p>
    <p class="note">If you learn more advanced methods then you will use this algorithm for another purpose. It is known as an anti-sune.</p>
    <p>The most important pieces to watch during the algorithm are these.</p>
