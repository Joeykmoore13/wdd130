        This guide is designed for anyone to be able to pick up a 3x3 Rubick's cube and solve it. You don't need to have any prior experience to use this guide. The only thing you have to do before using this guide is take a look at the “How to read notation” page. Without the notation it will be incredibly difficult. 

Step 1: White cross
The first step in this guide is to solve a white cross. You can technically start with any color you want but this guide will start with white. 

The most important thing to note is the other color on the edge matters. See the pictures below. 

[Incorrect cross edge picture]
[Correct cross edge picture]

As you can see one of the white cross pieces looks solved but the other color isn't in the correct spot. The second picture you can see both colors match. 

Here's a couple tips on how to insert the edges into the correct spots

[F2 picture 1]
[F2 picture 2]

This is the best way to put edge pieces in. Using the U face you can align the cross piece with its other color and then do an F2 to insert the cross piece. 

[Flipped edge picture]

This is the other possible case to get. The best way to do this is to line up the piece like this picture above and do these moves. Watch where the piece goes while to do the moves to see how it works. 
U’ R’ F R

As you can see the piece was flipped over and put in the correct spot and all of our other cross pieces are still correct. 

Your cube should look something like this

[Solved white cross picture]

Step 2: White corners

Our next step is to finish our first layer by putting in the corners. Much like the cross pieces the edge color does matter. Here's an example. 

[Incorrect white corner picture]
[Correct white corner picture]

As you can see the first picture the corner is in the wrong spot. The edge colors don't match up to the cross pieces around it. The second picture is correct though because the edge colors match up to the cross pieces around it. 

Here's a couple of ways to put in the corners. 

The first is pretty simple and it looks like this. 

[R U’ R white corner picture]

The important thing about this is to notice that to insert the corner you are going to have to move a cross piece. It is completely impossible to put a corner in without moving a cross piece. In this case we are going to lift our cross edge up like this

[R U’ R’ white corner R move picture]

Then we are going to move our corner right next to the cross piece to ‘stick’ the white ‘stickers’ together.

[R U’ R’ white corner R U’ moves picture]

Then we are going to put both pieces back into the first layer like this

[R U’ R’ white corner solved picture]

This also works on the opposite side which looks like this

[L’ U L white corner picture]

The second case looks like this

[U facing white corner picture](//Not above it's target slot) 

The previous cases had the corner facing the sides but this one is facing up which means the previous method won't work for this corner. The easiest thing to do is this. Get the corner above the spot it needs to go like this

[U facing white corner above slot picture]

Then do these moves. 

R U2 R’

Now the corner should be facing the side and you can just treat it like one of the above cases. 

If the corner is in the wrong slot like in this picture

[White corner in wrong slot picture]

Then just put a different corner into the slot using the above methods and solve it like normal. 

Your cube should look something like this now

[White layer solved picture]

Congrats! You now have one layer solved! 

Step 3: Second layer

Now we are going to move on to solving the second layer. There are 2 different cases you can get for this step and both are mirrors of each other. 

The first one looks like this

[F2L left case picture]

For this one make sure the center color and edge colors are the same like this

[F2L left case highlighted colors picture]

If they aren't the same then the piece won't solve correctly

Once your piece is set up like the first picture then do these moves

U’ L’ U L U F U’ F

//Add a link to another page for help on how to recognize and learn this algorithm

The second case is the same as the first but from the right side. It looks like this

[F2L right case picture]

U R U’ R’ U’ F’ U F

The third case is a little different. It looks like this

[F2L flipped edge picture]

As you can see the edge is in the right spot but flipped over. To do this one we just put a different edge into the slot and then solve the edge like normal. Either of the previous algorithms work for this case. 

Your cube should look something like this

[F2L done picture]

Step 4: Yellow cross

For this step we are going to make a cross out of the yellow pieces on top while keeping the rest of our cube solved. This step has 4 possible cases.

The first is the bar case and it looks like this

[Yellow cross bar picture]

To solve the cross with this case make sure the bar is set up like the picture above. If the bar is turned 90 degrees then the algorithm won't work. 

F R U R’ U’ F’

The second case is the L case and it looks like this

[Yellow cross L picture]

To solve this turn the L shaped part to the back left just like in the picture and then do the last algorithm twice. 

The third case is the dot case and looks like this

[Yellow cross dot picture]

To do this case just do the algorithm once and it will give you a new case. Then solve that case like normal. 

The 4th possible case is the best one. It is just solved for you. 

Your cube should look like this now

[Yellow cross solved picture]

Step 5: Cross edges

The next step is going to be moving the yellow cross edges into their solved positions. 

[Yellow cross unpermuted picture]

As yo can see from this picture the yellow cross is solved but the edge colors are not solved. This algorithm will swap the 2 edges marked in the picture below. 

[Sune edge swap picture]

Using this algorithm we can solve the 4 edges. To find which edges are already solved turn the U face until at least 2 edges are solved and then use this algorithm to swap edges until they are all solved. 

R U2 R’ U’ R U’ R’

Your cube should look like this

[Solve yellow cross picture]

Step 6: Yellow corner positions

Next we are going to move our yellow corner pieces around until they are in the correct spot. They will be twisted still but that is on purpose. 

Here's an example of a piece that is in the correct spot but still twisted and one that is in the wrong spot. 

[Correct corner picture]

[Incorrect corner picture]

In the first you can see that the color of the corner piece matches the sides around it which means that it is in the correct spot on the cube. The second corners colors do not match the sides around it so we'll have to move it. 

This algorithm will move 3 corners around. To use this algorithm put a solved Corner piece in the bottom right like in the picture below. 

[Niklas setup picture]

The bottom right corner is the only one that won't move in this step. This algorithm will move the other 3 corners around. Keep moving the corners around until they are all in the correct spot. 

L’ U R U’ L U R’

Your cube should now look something like this although yours might be slightly different. 

[Permuted corners picture]

Step 7: Twist yellow corners

The final step is to twist the corners that we just moved around. This is the step most people will mess up the most but just follow the moves EXACTLY and it will work just fine. For this step DO NOT rotate the cube around. The way the cube is facing matters for this step. 

To start twist the U face so that an unsolved corner is in the bottom right position like this

[twist set up]

Then do this algorithm over and over until that corner is solved

R’ D’ R D

Once that corner is solve it will look like the rest of the cube is messed up like shown in the picture down below

[twist halfway picture]

This is fine. Just don't rotate the cube around it it will solve itself. 

Next use only U moves to put another unsolved corner in the bottom right spot and use the algorithm over and over until that corner solves. Repeat for all the corners in the U face. Once the last corner is solved the rest of the cube should also be solved. 

Congrats! You solved a Rubick's cube.
