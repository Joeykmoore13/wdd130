    <h2 class="title">Intermediate techniques</h2>
    <hr class="line first_line">
    <p>This section is for once you have completed the beginners tutorial and want to start learning more efficent and faster methods of solving the cube. Its recomended to memorize the whole beginners tutorial before starting this section</p>
    <h2>Step explanation</h2>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>The first thing we need to do is to understand what is different about the more advanced methods than the beginners method. <br><br>The beginners method is the one taught in the main tutorial of this site. Layer-by-layer is the intermediate version of the beginners method. It changes the order of a couple of steps and uses some more efficient methods. Layer-by-layer is basically a simplified version of CFOP and a great way to build up to CFOP. CFOP is one of the most advanced methods cubers use. CFOP stands for Cross, F2L (Which stands for First 2 Layers), Orient Last Layer, and Permute Last Layer. Roux is also another great advanced method that has its own pros and cons but won't be taught here. It has a more intuitive aproach to solving the cube and doesn't use nearly as many algorithms as CFOP but some of the techniques used are a little harder to pick up than in CFOP.<br><br>This page will focus mostly on layer-by-layer and the advanced page will focus on full CFOP.</p>
    <p>The steps for layer-by-layer are as follows. Solve the white cross, either solving white corners then solving the 2nd layer OR doing F2L, solving the yellow face (known as orienting the yellow face) in 2 steps, then permuting the yellow layer.</p>

    <h2>2-Look OLL</h2>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>This step solves a yellow face but it splits it into 2 seperate steps or "2 looks". First we are going to solve the yellow cross and then the corners. The yellow cross in this step is solved very similar to the beginners metehod but with 2 more algorithms to make it faster.</p>
    <img src="../image/yellow_cross_bar">
    <p>For this case we use the exact same algorithm as used in the beginners method</p>
    <p class="alg">F R U R’ U’ F’</p>
    <img src="../image/yellow_cross_dot">
    <p>For this case we are going to use a very similar algorith except it is going to use wide moves</p>
    <p class="note">Note: The lowercase letters are wide moves, not regular moves. See the advanced notation section at the bottom of this page for how wide moves work</p>
    <p class="alg">f R U R' U' f'</p>
    <img src="../image/yellow_cross_L">
    <p>For this case there are some algorithms that can solve the cross in one go but they are kind of tricky to do so the most efficent way to do this with 2 look is to just to the other 2 algorithms back to back. It doesn't matter what order you do them in but just do one and then immediately do the other one. Try to memorize doing this case as one algorithm instead of doing 2 seperate algorithms to make it faster.</p>
    <p>Your cube should now look something like this</p>

    <h2>2-Look Pll</h2>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>This step, like 2-look OLL, is split into solving the edges and corners seperate.</p>
    
    <h3>Corners</h3>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>For this step there are 2 possible cases.</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of adjacent corners PLL case -->
    <p>The first case is the adjacent corners case and there are 2 ways of solving it. You choose which method you prefer. We can recognize this case by looking for a set of "headlights" made by 2 corners like this:</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create na image of adjacent corners with the headlights highlighted -->
    <p>The first way of solving this case is to put the headlights on the LEFT side and to do this algorithm.</p>
    <p class="alg">(R U R' F')(R U R' U')(R' F R2 U' R')[U']</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This algorithm is just a J-perm from the PLL step on the advanced page</p>
    <p>The other way to solve this case is to put the headlights facing the BACK and to do this algorithm</p>
    <p class="alg">(R' F R') B2 (R F' R') B2 R2</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This algorithm is the Aa-Perm from the PLL step on the advanced page just rotated by an x' move</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of diag corners PLL case -->
    <p>The second case we can get is the diagonal corners case. We can tell we have diagonal corners because we cannot find any headlights. The best way to solve this is to do this algorithm. The angle we do this algorithm from does not matter.</p>
    <p class="alg">F (R U' R' U')( R U R' F')(R U R' U')(R' F R F')</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This algorithm is the Y-perm from the PLL step on the advanced page</p>

    <h3>Edges</h3>
    <hr class="line">
    <p>This step has 4 possible cases</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of a Ua perm -->
    <p class="alg">M2 U M U2 M' U M2</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This is the Ua-perm from the PLL section on the advanced page. There are other algorithm options there if this is one you don't like.</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of a Ub perm -->
    <p class="alg">M2 U' M U2 M' U' M2</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This is the Ub-perm from the PLL section on the advanced page.  There are other algorithm options there if this is one you don't like.</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of an H-perm -->
    <p class="alg">M2 U M2 U2 M2 U M2</p>
    <p class="note">Note: THis is the H-perm from the PLL section on the advanced page</p>
    <img src="NEED IMAGE HERE">
    <!-- Create an image of a Z-perm -->
    <p class="alg">(M2 U M2 U)(M' U2)(M2 U2 M')[U2]</p>
    <p class="note">Note: This is the Z-perm from the PLL section on the advanced page</p>
